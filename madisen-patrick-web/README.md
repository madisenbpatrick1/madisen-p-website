# 🌸 MBP Original — Personal Creative Website  

**A digital home for my creative and technical projects.**  
Built with React, this site brings together my love for design, storytelling, and code — all wrapped in a retro, cinematic aesthetic inspired by *Architectural Digest* and classic pixel art.
