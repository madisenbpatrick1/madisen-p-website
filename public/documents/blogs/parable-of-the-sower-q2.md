> “God is Change.” — *Octavia E. Butler, Parable of the Sower*

### 🔁 The Comfort of Change

The central tenet of **Earthseed**, that *“God is Change,”* provides comfort in its honesty about the nature of existence. In a world where time never ceases and transformation is inevitable, Butler’s theology acknowledges an immutable truth: change is both constant and inescapable.

Within the post-societal chaos of *Parable of the Sower*, where lives unravel in an instant, this idea offers stability through paradox. The recognition that *“God is power… God exists to be shaped. God is Change”* (pg. 10) becomes an anchor amid instability suggesting that although suffering is unavoidable, it can be directed, molded, and perhaps redeemed through human agency.

### 🕊️ Faith as Freedom

What makes Earthseed liberating, is its inversion of passivity in faith. Rather than worshiping a distant, anthropomorphic deity, its followers are invited to participate in divine creation by shaping change itself. The belief that *“God exists to be shaped”* grants humanity both responsibility and freedom. It empowers believers to co-create the future rather than surrender helplessly to it.

### ✝️ A Personal Reflection

Personally, I do believe that God possesses consciousness and agency, and in that sense, I find Earthseed’s impersonal theology incomplete. Butler’s vision parallels aspects of Christian faith. The notion that *“God can change your situation for the better or worse”* echoes familiar doctrines. Religion, whether traditional or speculative, teaches trust in the unseen. To me, that is where Lauren’s vision finds its emotional appeal. She distills her father’s ministry, Baptist preacher, into something stripped of ornamentation yet rich in truth. Faith not as a blind optimism but as an active with the inevitability of change.
