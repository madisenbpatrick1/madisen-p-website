### 🌪️ A World in Flux

After reading Parable of the Sower, it would be naïve and dare I say unrealistic, to claim that the world will remain unchanged. Lauren Olamina’s world is harsh, chaotic, and frightening, and while I don’t think America will end up exactly like that, I can’t dismiss the possibility entirely. History and human behavior suggest that dystopian futures are always lurking in some form. Even recent political slogans echo Butler’s predictions from the 1990s: “Make America Great Again” feels like a reminder that dystopian visions aren’t just fiction.

### 📚 Education as Survival

Today, America seems stable, but the cracks are there. Education, for example, is at risk. AI and shortcuts might help students pass, but true learning and comprehension are slipping. As Olamina observes, literacy separates those who survive from those left behind: *“Because I can read and write… And none of them can. They’re older than me, but not one of them can read or write anything”* (pg. 105). Without widespread education, society becomes easier to manipulate, and order begins to crumble.

### 💸 Economic Pressure and Social Strain

Butler also shows how economic and social pressures can destabilize life. *“Men do the essential shopping. Food prices are insane, always going up, never down. Everyone complains about them”* (pg. 80), she writes, capturing the stress of scarcity. She highlights the collapse of everyday luxuries: *“It’s hard to believe any household once had three cars, and gas fuels cars at that”* (pg. 73). And she underscores systemic exploitation: *“The new hires would be indebt to the company. That’s an old company-town trick – get people into debt, hang on to them, and work them harder”* (pg. 121). The despair of trying to get ahead is summed up starkly: *“There is no way to save any money or ever do any better” (pg. 87)*.

### ⚖️ Seeds of Instability

If trends continue, the next two decades could bring more inequality, more social tension, and more violence toward marginalized groups. Reading Butler’s vision is a reminder that while America today isn’t on the edge of collapse, the seeds of instability exist. How we respond—by valuing education, addressing inequality, and responsibly navigating technology—will determine the kind of future we create.
